Figured out the theme situation, needed to use remote_theme intead of the theme selection and use a little bit more code to make the selection. Trying to focus on the lecture, keeping up while working on this as well. Personally not a fan of this as my brain comprehends things too quickly, also need to work on my typing skills as it took too long to type this up without spelling mistakes. Now having issues with posts not showing up on landing page. Gonna figure out why. Temperarly removing updated theme to see if that fixes it for now, then investigation time.
