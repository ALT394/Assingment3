Figured out the theme situation, needed to use remote_theme inside the theme selection and not as its own command. Trying to focus on the lecture, keeping up while working on this as well. Personally not a fan of this as my brain comprehends things too quickly, also need to work on my typing skills as it took too long to type this up without spelling mistakes.
